## Business Understanding

The primary objective of this project is to optimize the direct marketing efforts of the bank by accurately predicting whether a client will subscribe to a long-term deposit. By achieving this, the bank can improve the efficiency of its marketing campaigns, reduce costs, and enhance customer targeting, leading to higher profitability and better resource allocation.

## Data Understanding

### Dataset Overview

- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository, <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing">link</a>
- **Content:** The dataset 'bank-additional-full.csv' comprises data collected from 17 marketing campaigns conducted between May 2008 and November 2010, resulting in 41,188 records and 20 inputs.
- **Attributes:** The dataset includes various features related to client demographics, previous campaign interactions, and economic indicators.
  
### Key Features:

- **Client Data:**
  - `age`: Age of the client
  - `job`: Job type (categorical)
  - `marital`: Marital status (categorical)
  - `education`: Education level (categorical)
  - `default`: Has credit in default? (categorical)
  - `housing`: Has housing loan? (categorical)
  - `loan`: Has personal loan? (categorical)
  
- **Contact Data:**
  - `contact`: Communication type (categorical)
  - `month`: Last contact month (categorical)
  - `day_of_week`: Last contact day of the week (categorical)
  - `duration`: Last contact duration in seconds (numeric)
  
- **Campaign Data:**
  - `campaign`: Number of contacts performed during this campaign (numeric)
  - `pdays`: Number of days since the client was last contacted (numeric)
  - `previous`: Number of contacts before this campaign (numeric)
  - `poutcome`: Outcome of the previous campaign (categorical)
  
- **Economic Indicators:**
  - `emp.var.rate`: Employment variation rate (numeric)
  - `cons.price.idx`: Consumer price index (numeric)
  - `cons.conf.idx`: Consumer confidence index (numeric)
  - `euribor3m`: Euribor 3 month rate (numeric)
  - `nr.employed`: Number of employees (numeric)

- **Target Variable:**
  - `y`: Subscription to a term deposit (binary: 'yes' or 'no')

### Potential Issues:

- `unknown` values in categorical variables such as `job`, `education`, `default`, `housing`, and `loan` represent missing data.
- `999` in `pdays` indicates that the client was not previously contacted.

## Data Preparation

### Steps Taken:

1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - No missing values. 

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed 12 duplicate rows from the dataset.

4. **Correlation Analysis:**
    - A correlation matrix was calculated for the numerical features to understand the relationships between variables. Some key insights include:
      - `pdays` and `previous` show a strong negative correlation (-0.59).
      - `emp.var.rate`, `euribor3m`, and `nr.employed` are strongly positively correlated with each other.
      - `duration` has a minimal correlation with other features but is crucial in predicting the target variable.

4. **Splitting Data:**
    - The dataset was split into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.

5. **Feature Engineering: Preprocessing Pipeline**
  - **For Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM**:
    - Numerical features were scaled using `StandardScaler`.
    - Categorical features were encoded using `OrdinalEncoder`.
  - **For Decision Trees**:
    - No scaling was required as decision trees are insensitive to feature scaling.
    - Categorical features were encoded using `OrdinalEncoder`.

  - **Decision Tree** had the best performance but with a lower AUC of 0.73 and the highest F1 score of 0.52, indicating a good balance between precision and recall.
  - **Logistic Regression** also performed well, similar F1 score 0.51 and better AUC 0.93.
  - **KNN** was fastest but had lower F1 and AUC.
  - **SVM** computationally very expensive as compared to other models and had lowest F1.

### Model Optimization
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using cross-validation and Grid Search:
  - **Logistic Regression**: Best parameters found were `C=0.1`, `penalty='l1'`, and `solver='saga'`.
  - **Decision Tree**: Best parameters were `criterion='gini'`, `max_depth=5`, `min_samples_leaf=1`, and `min_samples_split=2`.
  - **KNN**: Optimal parameters were `n_neighbors=21`, `p=2`, and `weights='distance'`.

The decision tree model provides insight into different customer segments, guiding targeted marketing strategies:

#### Segment 1: Low Employment, Short Call Duration
- **Characteristics**: Customers in regions with low employment rates and short call durations.
- **Behavior**: Less likely to subscribe unless call duration is slightly longer.
- **Recommendations**: Engage customers by extending conversations and focusing on understanding their needs.

#### Segment 2: Low Employment, Long Call Duration
- **Characteristics**: Customers in low employment regions with longer call durations.
- **Behavior**: More likely to subscribe, especially if there have been few prior contacts.
- **Recommendations**: Use the extended call time to build a strong connection and present term deposits as a secure investment option.

#### Segment 3: High Employment, Short Call Duration
- **Characteristics**: Customers in high employment regions but with short call durations.
- **Behavior**: Less likely to subscribe, especially with low economic confidence.
- **Recommendations**: Address concerns early in the conversation and suggest follow-up emails or digital resources.

#### Segment 4: High Employment, Long Call Duration with Favorable Economic Conditions
- **Characteristics**: Customers in regions with high employment, long call durations, and favorable economic conditions.
- **Behavior**: More likely to subscribe, particularly if economic indicators are positive.
- **Recommendations**: Emphasize the benefits of term deposits and introduce related financial products.

#### Segment 5: High Employment, Long Call Duration with Unfavorable Economic Conditions

- **Characteristics**: Customers in regions with high employment, long call durations, but facing less favorable economic indicators.
- **Behavior**: Decision to subscribe is nuanced and influenced by economic conditions.
- **Recommendations**: Provide products with flexibility and stress the security of the investment.
